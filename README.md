# Project for my Information Visualization and Visual Analyitics class (year 2021/2022)
My take on the assignment provided. The dataset used was chosen from the graphs provided at the Barcellona Graph Drawing 2018 Challenge.

I'm still working on this project and aim to publish on the Oculus App Store as a general use Graph Viewer.
